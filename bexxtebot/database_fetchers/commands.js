// this module should query the DB to dynamically build commands based on the stored data
// undecided if the program should store instances of the classes in memory to call back on
// or repeated calls to the db?
// it seems like storing it in memory should be reasonable
// though that would mean the program would have to rebuild the object at runtime whenever the db gets updated
